# HELPING HANDS
 A donation application for Social Service Organisations(SSO) and donor.
 
ABSTRACT:</br>
How often do you think of donating and you end up doing it? Such a paramount issue of communication gap between the donor and resource-deprived masses still prevail. Thus, to help in the smooth functioning of society, our project aids donors and Social Service Organizations (SSOs) to discover each other and support the community. 
Our startup idea is an Android-based application which acts as a moderator between the donors and the SSOs. It is a platform where any SSO with an ISO certification can easily register to become a part of a community. Here, they can share their requirements among the masses who are willing to support and uplift their conditions. On the donors' end, anyone who wishes to render help whether materialistic or via services can easily sign up on the app and connect with various SSOs. The application is open to people who want to contribute to the society through their services like organizing teaching sessions or free meal events for the underprivileged etc.
The application provides a separate section for SSOs to enlist their requirements and purchase/acquire goods and services from the donor at a nominal rate. If an SSO has anything in surplus, they are free to share their services among others.
A registered donor can upload the kind of donation he wishes to provide. The app enables the donor to render his services to a particular SSO but there will be some constraints like some percentage of the donation will be distributed among other SSOs.</br>
